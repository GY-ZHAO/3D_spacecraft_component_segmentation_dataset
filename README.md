# spacecraft_3D_component_segmentation_dataset
This project proposes a multi-source 3D component segmentation dataset for non-cooperative spacecraft.
## Where to gain 3D spacecraft models
 We download the CAD model of the published spacecraft from open-source websites, such as NASA (https://www.nasa.gov/, accessed on 15 March 2022), Free3d (https://free3d.com/, accessed on 15 March 2022), etc. Lately, we print the CAD models utilizing the 3D printing technology to get the 3D printed models.
